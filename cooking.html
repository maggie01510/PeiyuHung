            <h2>Life can be complicated, but cooking doesn't have to be.</h2>
            <p>As a loyal audience of Traveling n Living, I love to watch every gourmet show they released and enjoy watching the cooking process. The sentence above is also one of the quote I heard from one show of TLC and can't agree with that more. I may not a professional chef, but I'm passionate about food. When I was little, I always like to stand by my mom and watch her cook in the kitchen. Now, I have the ability to cook, I enjoy the time spending with different kinds of ingredient and sharing the delicacies with my family and friends. Cooking and baking, to me, is both physical and mental therapy.</p>
